            <p>I grew up side by side with technology that made me develop a big passion for it. I have always been a <i>techy</i> person, so in order to continue my journey, I got into a vocational course - Programming and Management of Computer Systems.</p>
            <p>That course went so well and it was such an enjoying experience, that made me apply for a college degree in Computer Science and Engineering </p>
            <p>Since then, I have never stood still, doing personal projects for both growing in knowledge by adventuring into new technologies and building my portfolio.</p>
